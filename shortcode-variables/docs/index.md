# What is Snippet Shortcodes?

> A WordPress plugin that allows you to a library of custom shortcodes and reusable content, and seamlessly insert them into your posts and pages for streamlined, consistent site updates. Plus, get a head start with a built-in selection of ready-made shortcodes to use out of the box.

Looking to reuse the same snippet of text or HTML across your website while only updating it in one spot? [Snippet Shortcodes](https://snippet-shortcodes.yeken.uk/) could be exactly what you need. With this tool, you can generate a library of custom shortcodes and embed them into your WordPress content. Using the familiar WordPress editor, you can insert anything from text and HTML to JavaScript, images, or any other elements supported by your theme or plugins. The biggest benefit? You only need to create the shortcode once, and you can then deploy it site-wide, saving time and ensuring consistency.

**Quick example**

By default, you tend to create content once and then copy and paste it across your site as needed. Later, when updates are required, you have to track down every instance, edit each one individually, and save every page or post - making consistent updates a tedious process. Instead, put a snippet like this into one of our [custom shortcodes](https://snippet-shortcodes.yeken.uk/shortcodes-own.html) and get a shortcode you can paste into your content. To update, all you need to do is edit the [custom shortcode](https://snippet-shortcodes.yeken.uk/shortcodes-own.html) and your entire site will update consistently.
