# Getting started
  
Before you start, ensure your hosting environment satisfies the minimum specifications outlined by the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). Unfortunately, YeKen plugins may not work on older versions.  

### Installing the core plugin (mandatory)

1. Install the [Snippet Shortcodes plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-variables/). In your WordPress dashboard, go to 'Plugins' > 'Add New' search for 'Snippet Shortcodes,' and click 'Install Now.'
2. Activate the plugin.  
3. To begin, create [your own shortcode]({{ site.baseurl }}/shortcodes-own.html). In the WP Dashboard, go to 'Snippet Shortcodes' > 'Your Snippet Shortcodes.' Then, click 'Add a New Shortcode Snippet' and follow the prompts.
4. Take a moment to explore the free [ready-made shortcodes]({{ site.baseurl }}/shortcodes-free.html) â€” you might find them quite useful for your website.

### Installing the Premium plugin (optional)

> Note: To get the Premium features, you must install both plugins and have a [Premium license](https://shop.yeken.uk/product/shortcode-variables/).

1. Install the [Snippet Shortcodes - Premium plugin](https://snippetshortcodes.yeken.uk/download/). Start by downloading the plugin zip file from [https://snippetshortcodes.yeken.uk/download/](https://snippetshortcodes.yeken.uk/download/).
2. In your WordPress dashboard, go to 'Plugins' > 'Add New'. Click "Add Plugin", choose the downloaded zip file. 
3. Activate the plugin.  
4. Purchase a [Premium license](https://shop.yeken.uk/product/shortcode-variables/) and apply via the WordPress dashboard, "Snippet Shortcodes" > "Upgrade to Premium".
5. You should now have all of the additional [Premium features]({{ site.baseurl }}/features.html) applied as well as access to the [Premium ready-made shortcodes]({{ site.baseurl }}/shortcodes-premium.html).
